# Welcome to the Grafton Machine Shed

The Grafton Machine Shed API Server is a batteries-included platform written in the Rust language and designed to serve multiple APIs, protocols and services. Our goal is to provide a robust, efficient, and flexible platform for hosting a wide range of applications that collaborate on the internet particularly with AI Agents and LLMs.  For more information about Grafton Machine Shed projects and capabilities, visit our [website](https://www.grafton.ai).

## Roadmap

The Grafton Machine Shed is a work in progress.  **This platform will not be stable enough to use in third-party projects until a future release.**

We are currently working on the following features:
- Basic http server (complete)
- Config loading with token variable expansion (complete)
- Multi-provider oauth2 login (in progress)
- Role Based Access Control (in progress)

Planned features and API's: (coming soon)
  - REST & Websocket
  - GraphQL
  - gRPC
  - Multi-modal realtime streaming
